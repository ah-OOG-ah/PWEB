# PWEB - I forgot what it stood for
This implements the requirements for Team 3
(forms and such) and Team 2 (formatting).

~~Yes I forgot to do this earlier how could you tell?~~

### Personal web page
This version made with a *little* more time and effort, it now has 
- Req. 1, Flexbox layout. I'll be honest, this one was on accident, I didn't realize picking
a different layout method was allowed... because the others are all super jank.
- Req. 2, a sticky footer. Honestly not really a fan of it, might replace it later.
- Req 4, a figure element. Not implemented properly though.
